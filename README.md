# Mastering Fine-Tuning with Databricks: Five Hands-On Use Cases

Welcome to the official repository for the book "Mastering Fine-Tuning with Databricks: Five Hands-On Use Cases."

## About the Book

This book provides practical, hands-on examples of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using Databricks. It covers five common use cases, offering detailed, end-to-end implementations to help you apply fine-tuning techniques effectively in real-world scenarios. Whether you are a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or AI enthusiast, this book will guide you through the process of fine-tuning LLMs on Databricks with ease.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following resources to complement the book:

- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used in the book's examples.
- **Databricks Notebooks**: Databricks notebooks with step-by-step code implementations for each use case.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for various fine-tuning tasks.
- **Documentation**: Additional documentation and resources for further learning.
- **Examples**: End-to-end examples demonstrating the practical application of fine-tuning techniques.

## Use Cases Covered

### Fine-Tuning Use Cases

1. **Customer Support Chatbots**: Fine-tuning models to handle customer queries and provide support using Databricks notebooks.
2. **Sentiment Analysis and Feedback Categorization**: Analyzing customer feedback and categorizing sentiment with practical implementations.
3. **Content Generation and Summarization**: Generating and summarizing content using LLMs on the Databricks platform.
